ty3bar - STILL IN PROD
----------------------

Commands to know:

    yarn install

    npm run lint
    
    npm run build
    
Use yarn... well if you change dependencies.

Use the linter - code MUST follow it. 

Use build to generate the executable, which goes into the root directory of the project.

Checkout the default.json for config

run like:

    /path/to/ty3bar --config /path/to/config [--simple]
